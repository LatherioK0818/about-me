            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, Welcome to my page.</p> I am Latherio Kidd.
             <h3>Short Biography</h3>
             I was born on May 10th in Monroe, LA. I am a father of an energetic 5-year-old daughter. Most of my time has been spent in the Air Force from 2015-2019. In that time, I worked on numerous humanitarian efforts with President Obama, Michelle, most of the nuclear summit, and other major events, including meeting Pope Francis. I also was a part of the deployment of the James Webb Space Telescope. My hobbies include video gaming, building furniture, playing football, and cooking gumbo.</p>
             <h4>Education History</h4>
             I obtained my Associates in computer science in 2014. I enlisted shortly after, then obtained my Bachelor's in the same field. I've obtained cybersecurity certifications, Azure cloud, and some UI Paths certifications as well. This completes my segment on my education history.</p>
